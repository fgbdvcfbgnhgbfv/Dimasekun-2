Dimasekun-2 is a multiplayer Roblox game set in the surreal, chaotic universe of Aboba, where former friends and enemies are pulled into Dimasekun — a world of endless games, twisted powers, and personal vendettas.

## Lore & Universe

The game is based on the **Aboba Universe**, a sprawling narrative of fictional nations, ideologies, and characters created by a group of friends. Key factions include:

- **Aboba** — a once-unified alliance now fragmented into multiple states.
- **Polina Reich** — a totalitarian regime led by Polina.
- **Serega’s Territories** — remnants of Aboba in exile.
- Various splinter states led by Danya, Sasha, Denis, Dima, and others.

Players take on the roles of characters from this universe, each with unique abilities, backstories, and alignments (Survivor, Killer, or Neutral).
